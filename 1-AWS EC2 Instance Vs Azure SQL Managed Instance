ðŸ”¹ Azure SQL Managed Instance
=============================
Pros:
Fully managed by Microsoft â€” you donâ€™t worry about patching, backups, high availability, etc.
Super compatible with on-prem SQL Server (almost full feature parity).
Built-in HA/DR, scaling, and monitoring.
Great if you're already in the Azure ecosystem or planning to eventually move there.
Native support for features like Linked Servers, SQL Agent, etc. (compared to Azure SQL DB which is more limited).

Cons:
Less control over the OS or environment (no RDP access).
May be more expensive than EC2 for light testing workloads.
Might take longer to provision (up to a few hours sometimes).

ðŸ”¹ AWS EC2 + SQL Server
=======================
Pros:
Full control â€” itâ€™s basically like running SQL Server on your own machine.
Fast to spin up and tear down for testing.
Can choose any version of SQL Server, customize OS-level settings, etc.
May be cheaper for quick test environments (especially if you use spot instances or turn off when idle).

Cons:
You manage everything â€” patching, backups, security hardening, HA, etc.
Not a PaaS offering â€” so no built-in scalability or auto-failover unless you build it.
More overhead if you're just trying to test queries or schema.

So... which should you go for?
ðŸ‘‰ Use Azure SQL Managed Instance if:
Youâ€™re testing for a future migration to Azure or managed services.
You want minimal management overhead.
You need to test things like cross-database queries, linked servers, or SQL Agent jobs in a managed setting.

ðŸ‘‰ Use AWS EC2 with SQL Server if:
You want full control, like OS-level access or specific SQL Server configurations.

Itâ€™s a short-term test or dev setup.

Youâ€™re more familiar with AWS or already using AWS infra.
You need to test legacy workloads that might not run well in a managed environment.
Got a specific use case in mind? (e.g. performance testing, migration prep, legacy app compatibility, etc.) That might help make the decision even clearer.
