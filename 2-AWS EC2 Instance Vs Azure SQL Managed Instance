Setting up a SQL Server test environment is a solid move. 
The choice between "AWS EC2" and "Azure SQL Managed Instance" really depends on what you're aiming for in terms of control, maintenance, and how closely you want it to mimic a production setup.

Here’s a quick comparison to help you decide:

🔧 If You Choose AWS EC2 (SQL Server on VM):
- Pros:
- Full control over OS, SQL Server config, and patches.
  - Closely mimics on-prem environments – great if your production is also self-hosted.
  - Flexible in terms of customization (e.g., SQL Agent jobs, third-party tools, linked servers).
- Cons:
  - You’re responsible for maintenance: backups, patching, high availability setup, etc.
  - Slightly more admin overhead.

🧠 Best if: You need full control, want to test specific OS-level behaviors, or simulate a lift-and-shift from on-prem.

☁️ If You Choose Azure SQL Managed Instance:
- Pros:
  - PaaS offering – Microsoft handles backups, patching, high availability.
  - Very compatible with full SQL Server feature set (almost like SQL Server in a VM, but managed).
  - Supports SQL Agent, CLR, cross-database queries, etc. – better than Azure SQL DB in this regard.
- Cons:
  - Less control over OS and instance-level configurations.
  - More expensive than running a basic EC2 VM.
  - May have limitations around features like certain extended stored procs or access to system databases.

🧠 Best if: You want minimal maintenance, a managed experience, and you're testing something close to a modern PaaS production setup.
